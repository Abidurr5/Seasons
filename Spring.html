            <p>The natural world regenerates and reenergizes in the spring after the chilly winter months.<br>Plants that have been inactive for a while start to grow again in the spring,
                <br>along with fresh seedlings and animals that have been hibernating.Spring <br>officially begins with the vernal equinox, which usually falls on March 20th <br>or 21st in the Northern Hemisphere and on September 22nd or 23rd in the <br>
                Southern Hemisphere. During the equinox, day and night are roughly equal in duration. <br>Spring is known for the blooming of various flowers, including tulips, 
                <br>daffodils, cherry blossoms, and lilacs.In many regions, spring brings milder <br>and warmer temperatures as the earth starts tilting towards the sun.</p>
