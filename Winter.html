            <p>Winter officially begins with the winter solstice, which usually occurs around <br>
                December 21st or 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere. It's the shortest day and<br>
                 longest night of the year. Winter is characterized by colder temperatures, often <br>
                 below freezing, which can lead to the formation of ice and snow. Winter is a<br>
                  popular season for sports like skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, and ice hockey. <br>
                  These activities take advantage of the frozen landscapes and cold temperatures.<br>
                  Winter is associated with various holidays and celebrations, including Christmas,<br>
                   Hanukkah, New Year's Eve, and Valentine's Day, depending on the culture and region.</p>
